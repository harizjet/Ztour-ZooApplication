# Ztour Mobile Application

Created Ztour Mobile for Hackathon CHIPTA 2020 Project 

# Project Description

ZTOUR is a mobile application that provides the tools to help in keeping stable revenues
while actively involved with the communities. This app has donation/sponsor features that
offer people to donate/sponsor in terms of monetary, animal adoption, and food supplies.
Beside, the app provides some interesting activities that people can learn about animals
and test their knowledge by joining the fun quiz that we provide. It also provides a way for
people to involve with the communities by volunteering. There are few fields that people
can choose to be a volunteer. For example research areas or photography.
In order to cope with the new norm, VR technology is suitable for people who want to have
fun but have constraints due to the current global pandemic situation. One of ZTOUR
specialty is Virtual Reality mode in conjunction with Google Tour Creator. With this
technology, user can get a real-life experience of going to the zoo. User just need to turn
on the VR mode in full screen, place the phone in front of the cardboard and tilt their
phone. The area of the zoo will be displayed, and user can explore it in 360 degree. VR
mode is optional as user can just explore the zoo using Google Earth that ZTOUR have
provides.
